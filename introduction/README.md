Challenges:

1. There are at least six domain-specific languages used in the little system I cobbled together to write and publish this book. What are they?

- Make
- CSS
- HTML
- yaml
- Jinja2
- Markdown

2. Get a “Hello, world!” program written and running in Java. Set up whatever makefiles or IDE projects you need to get it working. If you have a debugger, get comfortable with it and step through your program as it runs.

`cd HelloWorld && ./gradlew run`

3. Do the same thing for C. To get some practice with pointers, define a doubly linked list of heap-allocated strings. Write functions to insert, find, and delete items from it. Test them.

`cd linked-list && ./run.sh`
